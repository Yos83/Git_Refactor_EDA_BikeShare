This repository contains projects did for Udacity Programming For Data Science With Python Nanodegree.


## Project 1 : Investigate a Relational Database
[https://github.com/Yos83/Udacity-programming-for-Data-Science/tree/main/Project%201](https://github.com/Yos83/Udacity_Project3/tree/main/Project1)

### Overview:

This project consisted in the exploration of a provided database movie rentals in which the student had to run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the student's queries. 


## Project 2 : Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Overview:

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.


## Project 3 : Post your Work on GitHub
[https://github.com/Yos83/Udacity-programming-for-Data-Science/tree/main](https://github.com/Yos83/Udacity_Project3/tree/main)

### Overview:

This project consisted in using Git and GitHub with a simulated workflow to refactor Project 2.

The Project Submission consisted in the filling of a template with all the Git commands used to perform the requested tasks.
